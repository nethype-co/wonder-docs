# Support Policy

## Business Hours

Our support team operates **Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM CET**. We aim to respond within 24 hours, though faster responses are common. Requests are handled in the order received.

## Theme Licensing

Each purchase grants a **single-store license**. Multiple stores require separate licenses. Free support covers licensed themes, though custom code modifications are excluded. Custom work requires direct outreach.

## Customizations

Paid customization services are available for design adjustments, feature integrations, and custom functionality. [Contact us](https://services.nethype.co) for pricing details.

## Eligibility for Support

Free support applies to merchants who purchased themes through the **Shopify Theme Store** or directly from Wonder Theme. Theme updates are complimentary. Support is unavailable for themes from other sources; proof of purchase may be required. We reserve the right to deny support for abusive conduct.

## Theme Updates

Updates provide design changes and performance improvements. Updates are optional but recommended. We cannot guarantee updated themes match previous versions if design changes occurred.

## Limitation of Liability

Wonder Theme disclaims responsibility for direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages from theme or support service use. Support is provided without guarantees or warranties.
