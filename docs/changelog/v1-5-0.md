# v1.5.0  -  January 3, 2025

## Added

- **Always Visible Sticky Header**: a new header option to keep navigation persistently visible, enhancing usability and accessibility
- **Promo Block** for main product page: highlight promotions or features directly on the product page, boosting engagement and conversions

## Changed

- **Font Updates**: in January 2025, Shopify deprecated several fonts. All theme presets updated to use supported fonts. Merchants using obsolete fonts will receive Shopify notifications with alternative recommendations.

## Fixes and Improvements

- Improved logic for displaying Account and login links based on admin configuration
- Updated presets to ensure default settings are applied consistently, preventing issues when switching between presets where options could carry over incorrectly
