3. **Add a New Item** : Click on 'Add menu item'. Here, you'll create the entry point for your mega-menu. Enter the name for this item, in this case, "Bestsellers".
4. **Save Your Changes** : After adding the "Bestsellers" item, make sure to save your changes to update your store's header.

To add a promotion-menu to your Shopify store, you'll be working within the Theme Customizer. Here's how to proceed:

1. **Open Theme Customization** : From your Shopify admin dashboard, go to the 'Online Store' section and click on 'Themes'. Locate your current theme and select 'Customize'.
2. **Access the Header Configuration** : Within the Theme Customizer, navigate to the 'Header' section. This is where you'll be able to manage the settings for your store's header, including the promotion-menu.
3. **Add a Promotion-Menu** : Look for the option to 'Add Promotion Menu' and click on it. This will allow you to start building your mega-menu.
4. **Link Item Setup** : In the settings for the promotion-menu, specify the name of the link item you've previously created, such as "Bestsellers". This will link your promotion-menu to the correct item in your store's navigation.
5. **Column Configuration** : Decide on the number of columns you want in your promotion-menu. A standard layout would be 6 columns, but you can adjust this based on how you want to categorize your items.
6. **Customize Visual Elements** : Now, it's time to personalize your promotion-menu. Upload images, create headings, add descriptive texts, and set the appropriate links for each section. You can add up to 6 images, so choose images that represent your categories or products well and make sure they are consistent with your store's aesthetic.
7. **Save and Review** : After customizing your promotion-menu, make sure to review all settings and save your changes. It's important to ensure that all links are working correctly and that the layout appears as intended on your store's front end.
