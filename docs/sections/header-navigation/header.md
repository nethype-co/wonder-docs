## What is the Header section?

The "Header" is a crucial part of your Shopify store, serving as the gateway to your brand and the first point of interaction for your customers. It provides a navigational framework and access to key areas of your site such as product collections, search functionality, and cart overview. A well-structured Header can enhance user experience and increase the efficiency of your site navigation.
