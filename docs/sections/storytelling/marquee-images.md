### Marquee Images



The **Marquee Images** section brings motion and visual energy to your store.
It allows you to display a seamless row of images scrolling horizontally — from left to right or right to left — creating a modern and engaging effect.

This section works perfectly for showcasing brand visuals, partners, or product highlights. It includes customization options for animation speed, image size, spacing, and layout on both desktop and mobile devices.
Add your own images and optional links to make the section interactive and bring your store to life.

## How to set up Marquee Images section?

* Add a **Marquee Images** section

* Using the **Image** block, select the images you want to display.



* **Optional:** You can also assign a link to each image, so clicking it will redirect to a specific page.



* Adjust the **animation speed** and **direction**, as well as the **image size** and the **gap** between images for both mobile and desktop, according to your preference.



## Main settings

**General**

* **Heading:** Set the title for the section to introduce the marquee images.

**Section spacing**
