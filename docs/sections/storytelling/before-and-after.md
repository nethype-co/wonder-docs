## **What is the Before and after section?**

The **Before and After** section is a powerful way to showcase transformations and product effectiveness. This section consists of two parts: a content area where you can add customizable blocks such as a subheading, heading, text, and buttons, and an interactive slider that lets customers compare two images side by side. 

Ideal for beauty products, home improvements, or service results, this section visually highlights the impact of your offerings, helping to build trust and engagement with potential buyers.
