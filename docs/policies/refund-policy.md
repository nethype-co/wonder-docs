# Refund Policy

## Try Before You Buy

We strongly recommend taking full advantage of the **free trial period** available directly in your Shopify admin before purchasing. This allows you to:

- Explore all features and sections
- Test the theme with your actual products and content
- Verify the theme fits your store's needs and brand
- Customize settings and preview the result

The trial gives you complete access to the theme — take your time to make an informed decision.

## Shopify's Refund Policy

All theme purchases made through the Shopify Theme Store are subject to **Shopify's no-refund policy**. This policy is clearly displayed at checkout and applies to all paid themes, including Wonder.

Since themes are digital products, there is no way to verify whether a theme has been used, modified, or duplicated after purchase — which is why Shopify does not allow returns or exchanges.

## Requesting a Refund

If you purchased the Wonder Theme and feel it is not the right fit for your store, you may submit a refund request directly to [Shopify Support](https://help.shopify.com/). Please note:

- The final decision rests entirely with Shopify
- We are unable to process refunds or influence Shopify's decision
- Refund requests should be directed to Shopify, not to our support team

## Before Requesting a Refund

If something isn't working as expected, we encourage you to **contact our support team first**. Many issues can be resolved quickly, and we may be able to help you get the result you're looking for. Common situations we can help with:

- A feature isn't working as you expected
- You need help configuring a section or block
- The theme looks different from the demo

## Feedback

Whether or not you decide to keep the Wonder Theme, we genuinely appreciate your feedback. It helps us improve and make Wonder better for everyone. You can share your thoughts through our support channel or leave a review on the Shopify Theme Store.
