# Theme Licensing & Transfers

## License Overview

Every Wonder Theme purchase grants a **single-store license**. This means each Shopify store running the Wonder Theme requires its own separate license, purchased through the [Shopify Theme Store](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/wonder/styles/developer-preview).

This is in accordance with [Shopify's Terms of Service (Section 9.4)](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms), which requires merchants to hold a valid license for any theme in use.

## One License, One Store

- Each license covers **one live Shopify store**
- Running the Wonder Theme on multiple stores requires a separate purchase for each store
- Licenses are tied to the store where the purchase was made

## Multiple Markets on One Store

If you operate **multiple markets** from a single Shopify store (for example, a US market and a European market), you only need **one license**. Multiple markets within the same Shopify store are covered by a single purchase.

However, if you run separate Shopify stores for different markets, each store needs its own license.

## Development & Staging Stores

You may install the Wonder Theme on a **Shopify development store** (password-protected, not processing real payments) without purchasing a separate license, provided that:

- The theme has been purchased on the **production store** it is intended for
- When contacting support about a development store, provide the production store URL so we can verify your license

This allows agencies and freelancers to build and test client stores before going live.

## Unlicensed Usage

Themes obtained from sources other than the Shopify Theme Store are **not legitimate** and are not eligible for support or updates. If you are using an unlicensed copy, we strongly recommend purchasing a valid license or uninstalling the theme.

We reserve the right to report unlicensed usage to Shopify in accordance with their intellectual property policies.

## License Transfers

License transfers between stores are managed by **Shopify directly**. If you need to move your theme license to a different store, please contact [Shopify Support](https://help.shopify.com/) for assistance with the transfer process.

:::note
License transfers typically require closing the original store. Contact Shopify Support for the most current transfer policy.
