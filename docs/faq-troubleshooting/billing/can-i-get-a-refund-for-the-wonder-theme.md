## Can I get a refund for the Wonder theme?

When purchasing the Wonder theme, we strongly recommend taking full advantage of the free trial period available directly in your Shopify admin. This allows you to explore all features, test the theme with your actual products, and make sure it fits your store's needs  -  before committing to a purchase.

Please note that Shopify enforces a strict no-refund policy on all theme purchases made through the Shopify Theme Store. This policy is clearly displayed at the time of checkout and applies to all paid themes, including Wonder. Since a theme is a digital product, there is no way to verify whether it has been used, modified, or duplicated  -  which is why Shopify does not allow returns or exchanges.

If you have purchased the Wonder theme and feel it is not the right fit for your store, you are welcome to submit a refund request directly to Shopify Support. However, please be aware that the final decision rests entirely with Shopify, and we are unable to influence or predict the outcome of such requests.

We genuinely want you to have a great experience with Wonder. If something wasn't working as expected or the theme didn't meet your needs, we'd love to hear your feedback  -  it helps us improve and make Wonder better for everyone.
