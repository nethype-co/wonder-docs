# Refund Policy

## Free Trial

A **free trial period** is available directly in your Shopify admin before purchasing. The trial provides complete access to all theme features, sections, and settings  -  allowing you to fully evaluate the theme with your actual products and content.

## Purchases & Refunds

All theme purchases are processed through the **Shopify Theme Store** and are subject to Shopify's purchasing terms. Since themes are digital products, Shopify enforces a **no-refund policy** on all paid theme purchases. This policy is displayed at checkout.

For any billing-related questions  -  including purchases, charges, or refunds  -  please contact [Shopify Support](https://help.shopify.com/) directly. All payment and billing matters are handled exclusively by Shopify.
