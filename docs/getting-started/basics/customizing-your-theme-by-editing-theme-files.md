## **Customizing Your Theme by Editing Theme Files** 

While Split offers a range of built-in settings through the Theme editor, there are instances where you may require more advanced customization. If you're comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Liquid, you have the flexibility to modify your theme by editing the theme code to make specific changes.

### **Types of Theme Files:** 

Themes are organized into different file categories, each serving a specific purpose:

* **Layout:** These files control the overall layout of your theme, defining the structure and placement of elements.

* **Templates:** These files govern the layouts for specific sections of your theme, such as product pages or blog pages.

* **Snippets:** Snippets are reusable chunks of code that can be included in various parts of your theme to maintain consistency.

* **Assets:** These files encompass various media resources, including images, fonts, scripts, and stylesheets, which are used to enhance your theme's appearance and functionality.

* **Config:** Configuration files store settings and data specific to your theme's behavior and appearance.

* **Locales:** Locale files contain language-specific text pieces used throughout your theme, allowing for localization and translation.

* **Sections:** Section files govern the layouts of individual sections within your theme, offering granular control over content placement.

### **Accessing the Edit HTML/CSS Page** 

The "Edit HTML/CSS" page provides you with the capability to edit the code files that constitute your theme. Here's how to access it:

1. **Access Your Shopify Admin:** Log in to your Shopify admin panel.
2. **Navigate to Themes:** From the Shopify admin, go to "Online Store," and then click on "Themes."
3. **Open the Edit Code Section:** In the left sidebar, click the dropdown menu, and select "Edit code."
4. **Exploring the Edit Code Page:** The "Edit code" page offers a directory of theme files and an online code editor.

When you click on a file in the list, it opens in the code editor. You have the ability to open and edit multiple files simultaneously.

By accessing the "Edit code" page and exploring these various file categories, you can tailor your Shopify theme to meet your unique requirements and design preferences.

Remember that while editing your theme code offers extensive customization possibilities, it's crucial to exercise caution and back up your theme before making significant changes to avoid unintended issues.
