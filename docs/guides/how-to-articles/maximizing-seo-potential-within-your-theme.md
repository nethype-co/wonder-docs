## **Maximizing SEO Potential Within Your Theme** 

Unleashing the power of SEO settings within your theme is a strategic move to enhance your website's discoverability on search engines. Here's your guide to optimizing these settings:

### **1. Embracing Microdata Schema:** 

* Our themes come with built-in microdata schema, a structured data format that search engines like Google greatly appreciate. This structured data empowers search engines to grasp the content on your web pages, leading to more precise search results for users.
* The microdata schema integrated into our themes includes essential information:
- Store details (organization)
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Product information: Product name, Product URL, Product variants, Product images

* If you desire greater control or need to include additional information, our themes offer the flexibility to disable the theme's microdata schema. This opens the door for you to implement custom solutions tailored to your specific requirements.

### **2. Navigational Benefits of Breadcrumbs:** 

* Breadcrumbs are a user-friendly navigation feature seamlessly integrated into our themes.
* To enhance the user experience, especially for product and collection navigation, our themes adopt a breadcrumb structure that resembles this format: home/collection-name/product-name

* However, this structure may lead to multiple URLs for the same product, such as:
- myshop.com/collections/creams/products/firming-face-serum-orange-12-ml
- myshop.com/collections/women/products/firming-face-serum-orange-12-ml

* In contrast, Shopify ensures a single canonical URL for each product, following this format:
- myshop.com/products/firming-face-serum-orange-12-ml

* The debate over the impact of multiple URLs on SEO continues. To make the right choice, carefully consider your priorities and objectives. In most scenarios, if your website utilizes breadcrumbs, retaining this feature is beneficial as it enhances the overall user experience.

In summary, optimizing SEO settings within your theme, including microdata schema and breadcrumbs, is a strategic step to improve your website's visibility on search engines. Balancing the benefits of structured data and enhanced navigation against potential duplicate URLs is key to making the right decision for your SEO strategy and user satisfaction goals.
