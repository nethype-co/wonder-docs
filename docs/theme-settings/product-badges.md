### How to configure the Product Badges in your theme editor

1. **Assign Tags to Your Products** : Start by tagging your products in Shopify. To do this, go to the 'Products' section of your Shopify admin panel. Click on a specific product to edit it. On the right side of the product editing page, look for the 'Product organization' section. Here you will find the 'Tags' field. Input your desired tags here. You can add multiple tags to a single product. These tags will be displayed as badges on the product page, arranged in a column.
2. **Access Theme Settings for Badges** : Navigate to your theme's settings and locate the 'Product Badges' section. Here you will configure the visual aspects of your badges.
3. **Customize Badge Appearance:**
   - **Text Transformation:** Decide whether you want your badge text to appear in uppercase for emphasis or keep it in standard formatting by selecting 'none'.
   - **Color Settings:** Choose the text and background colors for your badges. This is crucial for ensuring that they are visible against your product images and align with your store's design.
   - **Matching Tags:** In the 'Tag' field, type in the exact tag that corresponds with what you've assigned to your products. For instance, if your product is tagged with 'Sale' in the inventory, input 'Sale' in the 'Tag' field to create a 'Sale' badge.
4. **Define Multiple Badges** : You have the option to create up to four unique badges, each with its own tag and color scheme. This allows you to categorize your products with various labels such as 'New', 'Sale', 'Bestseller', or 'Limited'.
