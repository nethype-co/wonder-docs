### Product Variations Block

The **Product Variations Block** offers a flexible way to display related products as selectable options on a single product page. Unlike traditional Shopify variants, this feature allows you to group standalone products and present them as variations, using visually appealing swatches. This is ideal for showcasing similar products, such as different flavors, colors, or types, while keeping them separate in collections and grids. Enhance your customers’ shopping experience by allowing seamless switching between related products directly on the product page

## Important Information

1. **Option Value Metafield** 
You can use a **"Color" type metafield** or a **metaobject reference metafield** (pointing to a metaobject that includes a "Color" field) to integrate Shopify’s color functionality. This allows you to assign either a **color value** or an **image** to the metafield, ensuring consistent and visually appealing swatch displays.
2. **Products** 
It is recommended to connect a _"Product"_ type metafield configured as a _"List of Products"_. This setup enables you to use a single product page template for multiple products, streamlining the process and maintaining a consistent design across variations.
