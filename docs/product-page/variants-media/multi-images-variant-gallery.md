## **Multi-Images Variant Gallery** 

The **Multi-Images Variant Gallery** is a powerful feature that automatically filters product images based on the selected variant, creating a tailored viewing experience for each option. Imagine you have a dress product with multiple color variants like Black, Red, and Navy. When a customer selects the "Black" variant, the gallery will only display images tagged for that color, ensuring they see exactly what they’re interested in. This is especially beneficial for products with numerous variants, keeping the gallery organized and focused.

## How It Works

To enable image filtering by variant, each image must have an alt tag matching the variant’s name. For example, if you have a “Red” variant, set the alt tag of each corresponding image to **#red** . This process is not case-sensitive, so tags like **#RED** , **#ReD** , and **#red** will all work seamlessly.

 **Multilingual support** :
If your store uses multiple languages, you can assign multiple variant names to a single image by separating them with a | symbol. For example: **#red|Rot|czerwony** will match English, German, and Polish variant names.

 **Important Note** :
When at least one image is tagged for a specific variant, only those tagged images will be shown for that variant. Variants without any tagged images will display all available images.

## Setting Up Alt Tags for Filtering

To set alt tags for images in Shopify, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Product in Shopify Admin** : Go to your Shopify admin panel and select the product for which you want to set up the multi-variant gallery.

2. **Select the Media Item** : Click on the specific image you want to assign to a variant.

3. **Set the Alt Tag** : In the media details, find the Alt Text field, and enter the variant name prefixed with #, such as #red for the Red variant.

4. **Save** : Save your changes to apply the filter for that image.

Repeat these steps for each image you want filtered by variant. This simple setup allows you to create a customized gallery experience, showing customers only the most relevant images for the variant they select.
