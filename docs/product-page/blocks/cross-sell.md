### What is the Cross sell?

The **Cross-Selling** feature is designed to enhance the shopping experience while increasing average order value. This feature displays in the cart drawer, showcasing additional products that customers might be interested in, based on the selected collection or items handpicked by the merchant. Customers can seamlessly browse through these recommendations and add them to their cart without leaving the cart drawer.
