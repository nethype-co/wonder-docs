## **Upsell block**

The "Upsell" block is an intuitive tool crafted to amplify the shopping journey on Shopify by presenting items that are perfect additions to the customer's primary choice. By smartly labeling the block, it becomes a subtle nudge for shoppers to consider how these additional offerings could enhance their main purchase. Retailers have the ability to handpick which products to spotlight, ensuring the suggestions are relevant and the page remains uncluttered. The design of the upsell items is customizable, with various button styles available to make these products stand out attractively. Implementing this feature can lead to a richer customer experience, encouraging higher spend per visit and elevating overall satisfaction.
