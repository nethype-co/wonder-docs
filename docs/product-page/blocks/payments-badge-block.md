### Payments badge Block

The **Payments Badge** block allows merchants to display available payment methods directly on the product page or featured product sections. It helps build customer trust by clearly showcasing accepted payment options, such as credit cards, PayPal, and other digital wallets.

Merchants can customize the badge by choosing between dynamically loaded payment icons based on their Shopify payment settings or uploading custom images for desktop and mobile views. This flexibility ensures the badge seamlessly aligns with the store’s design while providing clear payment information to customers.
